Recipes Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, aimed at solidifying fundamental HTML concepts. The goal of the project is to build a simple website that features a list of recipes, applying core skills learned in the previous sections.

Purpose

I am using this project as a foundation to strengthen my understanding of basic HTML structure, elements, and concepts like semantic tags, links, and lists. While this project primarily focuses on creating a functional recipe site, it also serves as an early step in building the skillset I will need to create my own personal website in the future.

Project Goals

    Build a multi-page website with a consistent structure.
    Practice using HTML tags for layout and content organization.
    Link between different pages within the project.
    Apply good practices for clean, readable code.

Future Plans

This project is just the beginning! I plan to expand upon the skills learned here and gradually integrate CSS, JavaScript, and more advanced features to eventually create a fully responsive, dynamic personal website.
